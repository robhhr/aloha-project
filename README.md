### Aloha Project

<p>This is the first project in RED Academy in the program FS Web Developer. The main purpose of the project was to create a clothing company webpage that has different sections that contain images, texts, links and each section has their own styling.</p>

<p>There are 3 main breakpoints: Mobile (> 600px), Tablet (> 600px) and Desktop (1240px). Not all the sections change on every breakpoint, but some areas have changes in every breakpoint; navigation menu, hero image & texts. </p>

### Technologies used

The text processor used was:

- Microsoft Visual Studio Code

The languages used were:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Personal Learnings

<p>This is my first project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for web building. At first it was confusing because each one of them have their own complexity. But after a lot of practice and pratice, they become easier to understand and to apply the knowledge to the project itself.</p>

<p>The most challenging part was to understand the flexbox property and to apply it correctly to the website. But after some time, you realize how useful it is and how it makes things easier and more efficient for styling sections.</p>
